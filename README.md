### Hey, I am Ayush! 👋

- I’m currently studying <strong> Masters of Science in Analytics </strong> at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
- I'm a <strong> Graduate Teaching Assistant </strong> for the course - Computing for Data Analysis that deals with Data Science using Python.

My passion for Data Science began during my undergrad Computer Science degree, when I took subjects like Database Management Systems, Data Structures and Data Warehouse & Mining. My curiosity in these areas naturally led me to Data Science. Also, the extensive use of Statistics and Business impact made it the perfect fit for me.

I aspire to learn and add value at the same time!

This gives a brief overview of the kind of projects I have done!
